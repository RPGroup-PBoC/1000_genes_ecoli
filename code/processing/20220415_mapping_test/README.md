# 2022-04-15 Sequencing run

## Purpose
This sequencing run was a test run for a larger NextSeq run to confirm that our custom primers work as expected.
## Platform
MiSeq system (Thomson Lab)

## Sequencing kit
MiSeq nano kit V2. (300 cycles)

## Sequencing Modality
Paired-ends reads

## Materials

| **id** | **barcode-sequence** | **description** |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 100 | CAGTGT | Entire library |
| 110 | AGCCAT | Library Subpool |
| 201 | GTACTG | Library Subpool |
| 204 | ATCTCG | Library Subpool |

## Notes and Observations

The run had good quality, however, the cluster density was relatively low (about 550 K/mm^2), which therefore lead to a low 
number of total reads.
