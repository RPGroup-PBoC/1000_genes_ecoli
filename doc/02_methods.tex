\subsection{Growth Conditions}
M9 minimal media was prepared without carbon source by adding to 700ml of water 200ml of 5x base salt solution (Difco M9 Minimal Salts, 5x: 239mM Disodium phosphate, 110mM Monopotassium phosphate, 42.8mM Sodium chloride, 93.5mM Ammonium chloride, autoclaved), 100µl of 1M Calcium chloride, 1ml of 1M Magnesium sulphate, 10ml of 100x Trace Elements (3mM Iron(III) chloride, 0.35mM Zinc chloride, 76.5µM Copper chloride dihydrate, 42µM Cobalt chloride hexahydrate, 160µM Boric Acid, 8.1µM Manganese chloride)\cite{flamholz2020functional} and 1ml of 1mg/ml thiamine. The total volume is filled up to 1L and the solution is filter sterilized (Fisherbrand 500ml Bottle Top Filter, 0.2µm aPES membrane). Carbon sources were prepared as aqueous solutions of 20\% w/v. 

\subsection{Cultivation}
The cultivation procedure was adapted from \cite{schmidt2016quantitative} with slight modifications. Frozen glycerol stocks of the library were grown overnight in 200ml of M9 minimal media with 0.5\% Glucose in a 1L Erlenmeyer flask at 37C and shaken at 250rpm.
