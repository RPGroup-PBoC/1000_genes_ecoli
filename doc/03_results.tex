\tr{Does this belong into results or introduction?}
\textcolor{BlueViolet}{In total we present the regulatory architecture of x promoters, which tells us how a total of y genes are regulated. , 18 of which were chosen as so called "gold standards". These genes have well annotated promoters and have been studied in detail in previous experiments \cite{belliveau2018systematic,ireland2020deciphering}. Including this set of genes allows us to compare the method presented in this work to previous iterations and verify the results, as well as find possible derivations or improvements.}
